                <p>The CarePrints program was established in 2015 as a way to help families better understand their childâ€™s surgery to repair a congenital defect. Instead of using just standard CT or MRI images to try and explain the complex defects, the same data is used to generate a 3D model. This model is 3D printed and given to the family, allowing the surgeon to point out and explain each defect and how it is affecting the patient.</p>
